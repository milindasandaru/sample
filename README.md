# Brainfuck Interpreter & Examples

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! I updatesd this project with a minimal Brainfuck interpreter written in Python, along with several example Brainfuck programs.

## Features
- Minimal Brainfuck interpreter (`interpreter.py`)
- Example Brainfuck programs in the `examples/` folder:
	- `hello.bf`: Prints "Hello World!"
	- `add.bf`: Demonstrates addition
	- `echo.bf`: Echoes input
	- `multiply.bf`: Multiplies two numbers
	- `loop.bf`: Simple loop example

## How to Use
1. Run the interpreter with any `.bf` file in the `examples/` folder.
2. Explore and modify the examples, or add your own Brainfuck code!

## Testing
Unit tests are provided in the `tests/` folder. Run them with `pytest`.

This repository was created to learn Git and Python, and updated with Brainfuck language examples. Enjoy experimenting!
